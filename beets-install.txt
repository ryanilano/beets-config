I love how specific the media queries are on Discogs, you can use this to automatically search

Extrafiles
https://github.com/Holzhaus/beets-extrafiles
A plugin for beets that copies additional files and directories during the import process.
I use this to copy over anything in a folder that isn't music such as album art, logs, cue files, lineage notes, etc.
